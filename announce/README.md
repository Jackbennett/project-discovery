# Project Discovery Announcer

This module just sends a POST message about the project that just started running and the url to view it. A server listening for this message can print this name and url onto a page for other users to find.

This is great for use in environments where users (students) can be stopping/starting their work constantly and from a variety of computers which makes a fixed address impractical.

It's designed so a class can just focus on creating their own work but easily find their classmates in-progress work to view.

The server component can be found on [github](https://github.com/Jackbennett/project-discovery) where this module is also included.
