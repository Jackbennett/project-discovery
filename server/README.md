# Project Discovery Server

Hosts the page to view the announce projects for humans to discover. Eventually I hopet his to be a cli tool users can quickly run for their class.

## How To Use

1. clone/download/copy the code to a folder
1. navigate to ...`project-discovery/server` and run npm install
1. got to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

You should find this server itself announced as the first project

## Known Issues

- The console logs "problem with request: Parse Error": This needs catching, the port your are trying to use is taken. *(looking at you skype)*
